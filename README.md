In this paper, we develop a divide-and-conquer algorithm called Color-Splitting Algorithm (CSA) that takes ‚Ñé as input and generates a balanced ancestral coloring for ùëá (‚Ñé) in time linear in the number of tree nodes (excluding the root) 2^(‚Ñé+1) ‚àí 2. In fact, this algorithm can generate not only a balanced ancestral coloring but also any ancestral coloring (color classes having heterogeneous sizes) feasible for ùëá (‚Ñé). It is worth noting that this flexibility of our algorithm establishes the existence of optimal combinatorial patterned-batch codes corresponding to the case of servers with heterogeneous storage capacities as well. At the high level, the algorithm colors two sibling nodes at a time and proceeds recursively down to the two subtrees and repeats the process while maintaining the Ancestral Property: if a color is used for a node then it will not be used for the descendants of that node. The algorithm can produce a balanced ancestral coloring for the tree ùëá (20) below 1 second.
